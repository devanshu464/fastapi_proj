        "\n",
        "3. **Define an Async Route:**  \n",
        "   The `/async-operation/` endpoint calls the `simulate_db_call` function, which introduces a 3-second delay without blocking the server.\n",
        "\n",

        "   The `/quick-response/` endpoint demonstrates that other requests can be processed while the async operation is still ongoing.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Running the Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Save the code to a file, e.g., `main.py`.\n",
        "2. Run the FastAPI app using `uvicorn`:\n",

        "   uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Open your browser and test the endpoints:\n",
        "   - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/async-operation/`: Youâ€™ll see a 3-second delay before getting the response.\n",
        "   - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/quick-response/`: This endpoint responds immediately, even if the previous request is still being processed.\n",

        "### **Key Benefits of Using Async:**\n",
        "- **Non-blocking:** The server can handle other requests while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
        "- **Improved Performance:** Efficient for applications dealing with many simultaneous connections, such as web APIs or chat systems.\n",

        "3. **Add More Movie Information:**\n",
        "   You could scrape additional data like actors, directors, genre, or box office details by extending the scraper.\n",

        "3. **Forecast Endpoint:**\n",
        "   - You can create another endpoint to provide a weather forecast for the next few days by using OpenWeatherMapâ€™s `/forecast` endpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Caching Weather Data:**\n",
        "   - To prevent hitting the API too frequently, you can cache the results in memory for a short period (e.g., 10 minutes) using a cache library or a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Frontend:**\n",
        "   - You can add a simple HTML frontend with JavaScript to allow users to input their city and display the weather information.\n",

        "### **Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This FastAPI weather app demonstrates how to fetch real-time weather data from an external API (OpenWeatherMap) and serve it via FastAPI's RESTful API. The app can easily be extended to include more features like weather forecasts, support for multiple units, and more. You can integrate this backend with a simple frontend to make a fully functional weather web application."

        "1. **JWT Token Authentication:**  \n",
        "   For a production system, you would likely use JWT tokens to securely authenticate users and associate them with roles. In that case, `get_current_user` would decode the JWT and fetch roles from the token or database.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Database Integration:**  \n",
        "   Replace the in-memory `fake_users_db` with a real database (e.g., using SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM) to store and retrieve user data and roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fine-grained Permissions:**  \n",
        "   You can extend RBAC to include more granular permissions (e.g., read, write, delete) for each role on different resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Role Hierarchy:**  \n",
        "   You could implement role hierarchies, where an \"admin\" has all the permissions of a \"user\", and a \"manager\" has some permissions of both \"admin\" and \"user\".\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "RBAC in FastAPI is implemented using dependencies and custom security logic to enforce role-based access control. With this approach, you can easily manage user permissions and secure your application by restricting access to endpoints based on the userâ€™s assigned roles. FastAPIâ€™s flexible dependency injection system makes this process clean, maintainable, and highly customizable."

        "\n",
        "In FastAPI (and in web development in general), **stateful** and **stateless** authentication refer to different methods for managing user authentication and session information. Here's a breakdown of the two approaches, their differences, and when to use each in FastAPI applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **1. Stateful Authentication:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Stateful Authentication** requires maintaining a session on the server-side, where the server stores information about the user's authentication state. This typically involves storing session data on the server (e.g., in memory, database, or file) and referencing it during subsequent requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How it Works:**\n",
        "- **Login:** When a user logs in, the server generates a **session ID** or **token** and stores it on the server.\n",
        "- **Session Management:** The server sends this session ID or token to the client as a **cookie**.\n",
        "- **Subsequent Requests:** The client sends the session ID/token in the request headers (usually in the `Cookie` header). The server checks this session ID against its stored session data to validate the userâ€™s identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Pros of Stateful Authentication:**\n",
        "- **Server-Side Control:** The server can manage and invalidate sessions easily (e.g., force logout or track user activity).\n",
        "- **No Token Management on Client-Side:** Since the session is stored on the server, thereâ€™s no need for the client to handle tokens explicitly.\n",
        "  \n",
        "#### **Cons of Stateful Authentication:**\n",
        "- **Scalability Issues:** As the server stores the session state, it may become difficult to scale applications (especially in a distributed environment) because session data needs to be shared or synchronized across different server instances.\n",
        "- **Server Load:** Storing session information can increase server memory usage, especially if the app has many active users.\n",
        "- **Session Hijacking:** If cookies arenâ€™t secured properly, attackers can steal session cookies and impersonate users.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **When to Use Stateful Authentication:**\n",
        "- Applications with low to medium traffic and low scalability requirements.\n",
        "- Situations where you need fine-grained control over user sessions (e.g., session expiration or forced logout).\n",

        "### **2. Stateless Authentication:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Stateless Authentication** doesnâ€™t rely on storing any session data on the server. Instead, the server authenticates requests by using **tokens** (e.g., **JWT - JSON Web Tokens**) that contain all the necessary user information, and these tokens are self-contained.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How it Works:**\n",
        "- **Login:** The user logs in, and the server generates a **JWT** that encodes the userâ€™s identity and other claims (like roles, expiration time).\n",
        "- **Token Storage:** The server doesnâ€™t store session data; instead, the client stores the token (usually in **local storage**, **session storage**, or in the `Authorization` header).\n",
        "- **Subsequent Requests:** The client includes the token in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer <token>`). The server validates the token and grants access if it's valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Pros of Stateless Authentication:**\n",
        "- **Scalable:** Since the server doesnâ€™t store session information, stateless authentication is highly scalable. Thereâ€™s no session data to synchronize across servers.\n",
        "- **No Server Load for Storing Sessions:** The server doesnâ€™t need to track user sessions, which can reduce memory overhead.\n",
        "- **Ease of Use for Distributed Systems:** Because tokens are self-contained, they work well for applications with multiple instances, microservices, or APIs.\n",
        "  \n",
        "#### **Cons of Stateless Authentication:**\n",
        "- **Token Management:** The client needs to handle the token securely (e.g., in local storage or as an HTTP cookie).\n",
        "- **No Server-Side Control:** The server can't easily invalidate tokens unless you implement token blacklisting, making it harder to force logouts or revoke access before the token expires.\n",
        "- **Token Expiration:** JWT tokens typically have an expiration time, so the client may need to refresh the token (e.g., with a refresh token) or reauthenticate.\n",

        "#### **When to Use Stateless Authentication:**\n",
        "- Large-scale applications or microservices where scalability and server independence are important.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Login (`/login`):**\n",
        "   - The user sends their credentials (e.g., `username` and `password`) to the `/login` endpoint.\n",
        "   - If the credentials are valid, FastAPI generates a **JWT token** and sends it as an **HTTP-only cookie** to the client using `response.set_cookie()`.\n",
        "   - This cookie will be automatically sent with every subsequent request to the same domain, allowing the server to authenticate the user without needing to pass the token in each request explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Protected Endpoint (`/protected`):**\n",
        "   - This endpoint requires authentication. The `get_token_from_cookie` dependency extracts the token from the cookie sent by the client.\n",
        "   - The token is then verified, and if it's valid, the protected content is returned.\n",
        "   - If the token is invalid or missing, the server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` status.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Logout (`/logout`):**\n",
        "   - This endpoint allows the user to log out by deleting the session cookie using `response.delete_cookie()`.\n",
        "   - The cookie will be removed, and the user will need to authenticate again to access protected resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Key Concepts in the Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cookies**: In this example, the **JWT token** is stored in the user's browser as an **HTTP-only cookie**. The `httponly=True` flag ensures the cookie is not accessible via JavaScript, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Token Storage**: The **JWT token** is self-contained, meaning it holds all necessary user information (like the username and expiration time), and thereâ€™s no need to store session data on the server side.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Session Management**: Cookies automatically handle session persistence across requests. When a user makes a request, the browser includes the cookie with the token, which the server uses to validate the user.\n",

        "  \n",
        "- **Secure Flag**: For production environments, always set `secure=True` when setting cookies to ensure they are sent only over HTTPS connections. This prevents cookies from being exposed over unencrypted HTTP requests.\n",

        "### **Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "FastAPI provides a flexible way to implement session-based authentication with cookies. By leveraging **JWT tokens** or **session IDs** in cookies, you can authenticate users in a stateless or stateful manner. FastAPI allows you to handle authentication and authorization efficiently, providing fine-grained control over how sessions and cookies are managed.\n",

        "# **24. What are the best practices for securely storing user credentials in FastAPI applications?**\n",
        "\n",
        "When building FastAPI applications that handle user authentication, it is crucial to follow best practices for **securely storing user credentials** to protect against potential attacks, such as **data breaches**, **brute force attacks**, and **credential theft**. Here are the recommended best practices for securely storing user credentials in FastAPI applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Never Store Plaintext Passwords**\n",
        "Storing passwords in plaintext is a major security risk. If an attacker gains access to your database, they will have access to all user credentials. Instead, always store **hashed** and **salted** passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How to Do This:**\n",
        "- Use a **secure hashing algorithm** like **bcrypt**, **argon2**, or **pbkdf2** to hash passwords before storing them.\n",
        "- These algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making brute-force attacks more difficult.\n",
        "  \n",
        "##### Example using `passlib` with bcrypt:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install passlib[bcrypt]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from passlib.context import CryptContext\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create a CryptContext instance using bcrypt\n",
        "pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=[\"bcrypt\"], deprecated=\"auto\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Function to hash passwords\n",
        "def hash_password(password: str) -> str:\n",
        "    return pwd_context.hash(password)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Function to verify passwords\n",
        "def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:\n",
        "    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- `hash_password` will hash the password before storing it in the database.\n",
        "- `verify_password` will verify the hashed password during authentication.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Use Salted Hashing**\n",
        "Most modern password hashing algorithms, such as **bcrypt**, **argon2**, and **pbkdf2**, automatically salt the password (i.e., adding random data to the password before hashing it). This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed passwords will be different.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Salting** helps protect against **rainbow table attacks**.\n",
        "- The **salt** is unique for each password and is often stored as part of the hashed password (e.g., in bcrypt).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Use a Strong Hashing Algorithm**\n",
        "Avoid using weak hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1. Instead, use the following secure algorithms:\n",
        "- **bcrypt**: A popular choice for hashing passwords. It is slow and resistant to brute-force attacks.\n",
        "- **argon2**: A modern hashing algorithm that is designed to be memory and computation-intensive.\n",
        "- **PBKDF2**: A key derivation function that applies multiple iterations of a secure hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Implement Rate Limiting for Authentication Requests**\n",
        "Brute force attacks can be mitigated by limiting the number of login attempts per user or IP address.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Rate limiting** can help prevent an attacker from attempting too many password guesses.\n",
        "- Use libraries like **FastAPI's dependencies** or **Redis** to track login attempts and implement limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example using **FastAPI** with **RateLimit** dependency:\n",

        "    pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Secure Communication (Use HTTPS)**\n",
        "Passwords and other sensitive information should only be transmitted over secure channels. Use **HTTPS** (SSL/TLS) to ensure that data sent between the client and server is encrypted.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Always ensure that your FastAPI application uses **HTTPS** in production to protect user credentials from being intercepted during transmission.\n",
        "- In development, use self-signed certificates or services like **ngrok** to test HTTPS locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**\n",
        "For added security, especially for sensitive applications, implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**. This requires users to provide something they know (password) and something they have (e.g., an authentication app or email verification).\n",
        "\n",
        "FastAPI doesn't have built-in support for MFA, but you can integrate third-party libraries like **Auth0**, **Google Authenticator**, or **Twilio** for SMS-based or app-based MFA.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **7. Protect Against Session Hijacking**\n",
        "- When using **session cookies** or **JWT tokens** for authentication, make sure that cookies are set with **HTTPOnly**, **Secure**, and **SameSite** flags.\n",
        "  - `HTTPOnly`: Prevents client-side access to cookies via JavaScript (protects against XSS).\n",
        "  - `Secure`: Ensures that cookies are sent only over HTTPS connections.\n",
        "  - `SameSite`: Restricts the cookie to be sent only from the same site (protects against CSRF).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of setting secure cookies:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "response.set_cookie(\n",
        "    \"access_token\",\n",

        "\n",
        "### **8. Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Information**\n",
        "Never hard-code **API keys**, **database credentials**, or **secrets** directly in your FastAPI application code. Instead, use environment variables to keep sensitive data secure.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use libraries like **`python-dotenv`** to load environment variables from a `.env` file in development.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **9. Regularly Rotate Secrets and Keys**\n",
        "Regularly rotate your **API keys**, **JWT secret keys**, and other sensitive data. If any secret is compromised, changing it immediately can limit the potential damage.\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can implement key rotation mechanisms that allow for a smooth transition without disrupting the service.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **10. Avoid Storing Sensitive Data (Minimal Data Collection)**\n",
        "As a best practice, only collect and store the data necessary for your applicationâ€™s functionality. Avoid storing sensitive data like:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Credit card numbers** (use third-party services for payments).\n",
        "- **Social security numbers** or other sensitive identifiers (unless absolutely necessary).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **11. Secure Your Database**\n",
        "Ensure that your **database** is securely configured:\n",
        "- **Encryption at rest** and **encryption in transit** for stored data.\n",
        "- Regularly **back up** your database and ensure that backups are encrypted.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Steps to Implement RBAC in FastAPI:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define User Roles**: Create roles like admin, user, etc.\n",

        "- **`role_required`**: This dependency checks if the current user has the required role to access an endpoint. It compares the user's role with the required role (e.g., `Role.admin`) and raises an exception if the user doesnâ€™t have sufficient privileges.\n",
        "- **`permission_required`**: This dependency checks if the user has the required permission (e.g., `Permission.read`, `Permission.write`) to access the endpoint.\n",
        "- **`Depends`**: FastAPI uses the `Depends` dependency injection system to enforce checks on user roles and permissions before granting access to protected endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Test the Application**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you run the FastAPI app, you can test the following scenarios:\n",
        "1. **Access the `/admin-only` route**: Only users with the `admin` role can access this endpoint.\n",
        "2. **Access the `/read-content` route**: Users with the `read` permission can access this endpoint.\n",
        "3. **Access the `/write-content` route**: Users with the `manager` role and `write` permission can access this endpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Running the App:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "uvicorn app:app --reload\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Using **role-based access control (RBAC)** in FastAPI is straightforward and can be achieved by creating custom dependencies to check the user's role and permissions before allowing access to certain endpoints. This ensures that only authorized users can access certain resources based on their roles or permissions. By using FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system, you can keep your code modular and clean while implementing robust access control for your APIs."
