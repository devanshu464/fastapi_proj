        "In FastAPI, the `dependencies` parameter is used to inject reusable logic or functions into route handlers. Dependencies are a powerful feature that help simplify code, enforce consistency, and manage tasks like authentication, validation, database connections, or shared functionality across multiple endpoints.\n",

        "### Key Purposes of `dependencies`:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Code Reusability**: Define common logic once and use it across multiple routes.\n",
        "2. **Validation and Security**: Enforce authentication, authorization, or input validation before executing the main endpoint logic.\n",
        "3. **Dependency Injection**: Automatically provide objects (like a database connection or user object) to your route handlers.\n",
        "4. **Request Lifecycle Management**: Perform setup tasks before the request is processed and teardown tasks afterward.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Dependencies Work in FastAPI\n",
        "\n",

        "- Function parameters\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Using Dependencies in Route-Level Parameter (`dependencies` argument):**\n",

        "```\n",
        "> This method runs the dependency function but doesn't inject its return value into the route function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Global Dependencies**\n",
        "You can apply dependencies to the entire app or router:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(verify_token)])\n",

        "In FastAPI, the `tags` parameter is used to categorize and organize routes within the automatically generated API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc). By grouping related endpoints under specific tags, you improve the readability and usability of your API documentation, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand your API's structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Purposes of the `tags` Parameter:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Grouping Endpoints:**  \n",
        "   Organizes endpoints logically under different sections in the documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Improved Documentation:**  \n",
        "   Provides context by grouping related functionality, such as \"User Operations\" or \"Product Management.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Enhanced Navigation:**  \n",
        "   Allows developers to quickly locate specific endpoints in large APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Custom Descriptions:**  \n",
        "   You can add detailed descriptions to tags for further clarity.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Usage of `tags`:\n",
        "\n",

        "```python\n",
